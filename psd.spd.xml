  <description>FFT-based power spectral density (PSD) component that transforms data from the time domain to the frequency domain.  Output data is framed data where each frame contains the frequncy domain representation of a subsection of the input.  

This component provides both the real-valued PSD and the complex FFT outputs.</description>
